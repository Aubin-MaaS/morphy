### Fixed
- Fixed constructor accessibility issue in cross-file entity extension
- Updated changeTo, copyWith, and patchWith methods to use public constructors

- BREAKING CHANGES! copyWith_A is now copyWithA and changeTo_A is now changeToA
- This is to make the naming more consistent with dart conventions
- merged the PRs that allow to set explicitToJson false
- Call the class fromJson if _className_ isn't specified
- Support property name shadowing global types such as Type, String, Inâ€¦
- thanks to @miklcct for the PRs.

## 1.3.0
- bug fixes, subclass with no members now works, generic copy with bug now fixed where type is incorrect
- in order to fix the above problem the type returned from the copywith is now the type of the named copywith function, eg b.copyWith_A now returns an A type
- this is a BREAKING change.
- if you specify D newD = d.copyWith_A(); then newD will be of type D not A and you'll receive an error
- the thing is that if you know it is a d type you'd more likely do a d.copyWith_D() so this should not be a problem
